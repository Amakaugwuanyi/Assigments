      Hi! I'm Amaka Ugwuanyi.
Your business partner. A linguist by profession, a Virtual Assistant by choice. Like most millennials, I had difficulties choosing a career path.

It was important for me to learn new things and not get bored doing the same thing every day. So, my journey to self-discovery began. I have been a Personal Assistant, Administrative Assistant, and Administrative Manager. I dabbled along various professions, from makeup artistry to business, and farming.

Then I discovered Virtual Assisting.

Before transitioning into a full-time Virtual Assistant, I worked part-time as a creative content creator for nearly two years.

I saw that Virtual Assistance is a whole new world with burgeoning possibilities and a terrific opportunity for me to explore and thrive. I am no longer boxed, having the opportunity to constantly be on my toes, learning and relearning.

It has been an interesting transition in my career to work from home for more than a year now. 

For me, it is personal. When you hire my services, I behave as though my life depends on the success of your business, hence, I enthusiastically serve my clients, with money as just a by-product. My intention is always to help you save money and time, which is vital to the success of your business.
